employee payroll tracker challenge 
This is the readme file for the professional portfolio challenge! Week 3 challenge 3! 

This repo contains both the html and the javascript file for the employee payroll tracker challenge!

Feel free to explore any or all of these files! 

Most parts of the code were pre-made, but the rest were done with a lot of effort. (should tell you how long everything took to finally come together)

I must admit, I used the internet ALOT. I hope this is normal for the first few weeks. JavaScript it complex and not to be taken lightly. 

Yes I have to focus and practice more to be really fluent. Thanks google!

6.27.2024 -- still working on it, making sure while loop is functioning properly. 

While loops, isNan, are the most confusing so far. We'll see how it goes...

Update: Before we fly to NJ, I am turning it in. 

I need help on sorting employees alphabetically. Will go to office hours for this question. As always, thank you in advance for the feedback!
